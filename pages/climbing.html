    <h1>Climbing</h1>
    <p>
        Climbing is considered an extreme sport by many, but climbing can also be broken down into
        several subcatagories with varying degrees of extremeties.
    </p>
    <p>
        These would include:
        <ul>
            <li>Bouldering</li>
            <li>Sport</li>
            <li>Trad</li>
            <li>Speed</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Bouldering</strong> is what I spend most of my attention on. 
        It involves shorter climbs that require strength and technique to get through.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Sports</strong> climbing is about climbing high walls while attached to a rope 
        (unless you're Alex Honnald). This style of climbing does not require 
        as much strength as bouldering but is very enduring.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Trad</strong> climbing is by far the most extreme. Where as in sports you will have 
        anchor points drilled into the wall for you to clip your rope into incase you fall,
        trad climbing requires you to carry up cams and nuts that you will place into cracks 
        in the wall for you to attach your rope to.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Speed</strong> climbing is only seen in a competitive environment, such as in competitions 
        and the Olympics. Speed climbing will always involve the same route and is all about 
        getting to the top of the wall in the fastest time possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        When climbing with a <strong>rope</strong>, as you would normally do in sport or trad 
        climbing, you will wear a harness. A harness is a piece of equipment that you wear over 
        your pants and is strapped tightly to your legs and waist. The climbing rope is then tied 
        to the harness once it is securely tightened. The purpose of harness is to catch you if 
        you fall while climbing on a high wall, and safely distribute force to your waist.
        Climbers use the word "<em>wipper</em>" when someone has taken a big/bad fall.
