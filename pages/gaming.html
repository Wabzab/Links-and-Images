    <h1>Gaming</h1>
    <p>
        Everyone knows about gaming already, of course, and it is no surprise when you find out
        that it is someone's hobby these days. I have been interested in gaming from a young age
        when I was first introduced to the wonderous world of Minecraft. Since then I have 
        explored other titles and genres, with loads of laughs with friends sprinkled everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
        My personal preference of genre would be <strong>survival</strong> and <strong>open-world</strong> games, like:
        <ul>
            <li>Minecraft</li>
            <li>Terraria</li>
            <li>Skyrim</li>
            <li>The Witcher 3</li>
            <li>Deep Rock Galactic</li>
        </ul>
        I also enjoy complex games that have a high skill ceiling, such as you would find in 
        <strong>real-time-strategy</strong> (RTS) games like Age of Empires.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are those that see games as an unhealthy activity and a waste of time, but 
        from where I come from they are just way of relieving stress and reconnecting with 
        friends, and even connecting with complete strangers. I see them as no less unhealthy 
        or different from smoking to relieve stress or going to parties to reconnect with friends. 
        Take it as the introvert's alternative.
